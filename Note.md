## GOALS
### PHASE 1.
- Adding the shops to the app. The user/buyer will be able to :
    1. See available shops near it's location where to buy the needed items
    2. Pay online
    3. Ask for delivery or going to the store
** the shops data will be included in backend

### PHASE 2.
- Adding an interface for a new type of user: "the seller". The app would transform then into a connection plateform between sellers and buyers
**the shops data will be added by sellers themselves
